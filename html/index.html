    <h1>Hey! An Interruption Tracker for Mac users</h1>
    <p class="LemonYellowSun">
      "Hey! I've got a question."
      <br />"Hey can you take a look at this?"
      <br />"Hey, did you finish that thing?"
      <br />"Hey!"
    </p>

    <h2>Sound familiar?</h2>
    <p>
Interested in tracking just how many times you're interrupted and by who?
    </p>

    <p>Well hey, maybe <span class="LemonYellowSun">Hey!</span> is the tool for
    you.</p>

    <p>When someone walks up to you and starts talking, breaks your concentration with
yet another slack message, or diety forbid, actually calls your phone...just
type <code>hey &lt;person's name&gt;</code> on the command line.
  </p>

  <p>That's it. An entry in a local db will be created for the event, who did
  it, and when it happened.</p>

    <p>Want to start tracking _why_ people are interrupting you? After the interruption
you can, optionally, list and tag the events, leave a note,
or generate reports graphing all your past interruptions.</p>

    <p>Track it for long enough and patterns are sure to emerge. Maybe you'll find
that a little documentation could save you hours a week. Maybe you'll find that
one person that's devouring more time than anyone else and discuss a better way to
handle things.</p>

    <h2>Reports</h2>
    <p>So far, we've got 2 reports, with more on the way:</p>
    <p>First, a stacked bar chart showing interruptions, by person,
    by hour since yesterday at midnight. You can check out an example of it
    <a href="stacked_bar_chart.html">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>To invoke it just type
    <code>hey graph people-by-hour</code></p>
    <p>Second, we've got the old school command line report that looks like
    this:
    <br />
    <pre><code>Recent interrupts: Chronological order
Starting at midnight yesterday.

ID | Who       | When                 | Tags
2. | Bob, Mary | 4/12/17 14:23        | meeting, scheduled
3. | Bob       | 4/12/17 14:26        |
4. | Sam       | 4/12/17 16:11        | question
5. | Mary      | 4/12/18 09:22        | task list
    </code></pre></p>
    <p>To invoke that just type <code>hey graph</code></p>

    <h2>Questions</h2>
    <h3>How do I use it?</h3>
    <p>That's detailed on the
    <a href="https://interrupttracker.com/usage.html">usage</a> page</p>
    <h3>How Much?</h3>
    <p>It's free!</p>

    <h3 class="LemonYellowSun">Why not a GUI app?</h3>
    <p>Actually, I've got one all sketched out. I even paid someone else to
    write it, but they turned out to be incompetent and never gave me any
    working code despite going over budget.</p>
    <p>So, I'll get there eventually, but in the meantime I needed to throw
    something together quickly that I could use to get a handle on my constant
    stream of interruptions, and this was something I could through together
    "quickly". Unfortunately it's turned into a surprisingly deep rabbit-hole
    where I say "oh, I could just add this one little thing." far too many
    times.</p>
